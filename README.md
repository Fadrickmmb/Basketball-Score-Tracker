# Basketball-Score-Tracker

Simple app to keep track of a Basketball game Score.

The user has 03 buttons for each team. The first button adds 3 points to that teams score, the second adds 2 points and the last one adds 1 point.

After the game is finished the user can press the button "Result", that will generate a Pop Up with the Score and will show the winner (or if its a draw). There is also a "Reset" button, to reset each team's score.

Just a simple app for learning the basics of Android Studio.
